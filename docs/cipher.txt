Cipher is responsible for implementing the ciphering feature.
It should accept a ciphered string and return it deciphered.
The cipher will be stored in a file named key.txt, stored in a folder,
ciphers, (in the same directory of the program, or in the root of your project folder.)
This file will contain two lines, the first line is the actual letter, the second line is the cipher match.
When the cipher is accessed, it must be validated.

Class Cipher
-----------------
-key_number: int
-data: String
-key_original: String
-key_cipher: String

+Cipher(String data, int key_number) # constructor that takes data and key number as arguments.
+setData(String data):void # setter for data for testing
+setKeyNumber(int key_number):void # setter for key_number for testing
-getKeyLine(int line_index):String # gets data from a specified line index in the key file
-validateKey():Boolean # checks if the key is valid, that is, original (line 1) and cipher (line 2) have the same length
+decipherData():String # deciphers the data using the cipher in the key
