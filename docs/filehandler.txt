FileHandler is tasked with reading files and writing/returning its values.
It is also responsible for ensuring the file paths passed exist, ideally catching and preventing IOexceptions as well.
FileHandler imports a variety of IO/File management libraries from the standard JDK.

Class FileHandler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+FileHandler() # blank constructor for the class that is called if there are no commandline arguments.
+readDefaultFiles():String # Gives a list of files in the data folder. Does so by combining the user directory and stored docs folder name.
+readFile(String path):ArrayList<String> # reads the contents of a file from a specified path string. Calls the path parameter overload.
+readFile(Path path):ArrayList<String> # returns the list of lines from a file in a specified path. Checks to make sure that the provided path is valid.
+readFileFromDataFolder(String fileName):ArrayList<String> # Takes the fileName of a txt file in a data folder and reads it. Returns the list of lines in the file.
+readFileIndex(String path, int charIndex):char # Reads a specified character at an index from a specified path
+readFileIndexFromData(String fileName, int charIndex):char # Uses readFileIndex as a helper method to return a character from a specified index, from the data folder.
+readCipherFolder(String cipherName):List<String> # private function reads from a filename in the cipher index and returns the character's lines
+readCipherFromID(ind id):List<String> # returns a list of lines for a cipher file, from a specified index within the cipher file.
+getDataPath():String # getter for the data path
