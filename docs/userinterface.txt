The user interface for TopSecret is a Command Line Interface (CLI).
When the program runs with no arguments, it displays a numbered list
of all available files in the data folder and then exits. If the
user provides a single argument, the program interprets it as the
numeric index of a file and displays the contents of that file in
the terminal. If the argument is not numeric or does not correspond
to a valid file number, an error message is printed, and
the program exits. When two arguments are provided, the first is
treated as the file number and the second as an optional key file and then
the program prints the file contents along with a message indicating
the key being used, supporting deciphering functionality. If
more than two arguments are entered, the program prints “Too many
arguments.” and exits.
